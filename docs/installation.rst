*************************************
``SalishSeaCmd`` Package Installation
*************************************

``SalishSeaCmd`` is a Python package that provides the :program:`salishsea`
command-line tool for doing various operations associated with the
:ref:`SalishSeaNEMO` model.
It is an extension of the ``NEMO-Cmd`` package customized for working with
the SalishSeaCast NEMO model.

These instructions assume that:

* You have up to date clones of the :ref:`SalishSeaCmd-repo` and :ref:`NEMO-Cmd-repo`
  repositories
* You have a `Conda`_ Python environment and package manager
  (`Miniforge`_ or `Miniconda3`_)
  installed

  .. _Conda: https://conda.io/en/latest/
  .. _Miniforge: https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge
  .. _Miniconda3: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

To install the ``SalishSeaCmd`` package so that the :command:`salishsea` command is
available in your :file:`$HOME/.local/bin/` directory,
go to the directory in which you cloned the :ref:`SalishSeaCmd-repo`
and :ref:`NEMO-Cmd-repo` repositories, then do:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda env create -f SalishSeaCmd/envs/environment-hpc.yaml
    $ conda activate salishsea-cmd
    (salishsea-cmd)$ python3 -m pip install --user --editable NEMO-Cmd
    (salishsea-cmd)$ python3 -m pip install --user --editable SalishSeaCmd

The ``--editable`` option in the :command:`pip install` commands installs the packages
in a way that they can be updated when new features are pushed to GitHub by simply
doing a :command:`git pull` in the package clone directories.

The ``--user`` option in the :command:`pip install ... SalishSeaCmd` command installs
the :command:`salishsea` command in your :file:`$HOME/.local/bin/` directory which is
where the :file:`SalishSeaNEMO.sh` shell scripts generated by the :command:`salishsea run`
command expect to find it.

The ``SalishSeaCmd`` package can also be installed in an isolated :program:`conda`
environment.
The common use case for doing so it development,
testing,
and documentation of the package;
please see the :ref:`SalishSeaCmdPackageDevelopment` section for details.
