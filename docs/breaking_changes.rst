*************************************************************
``SalishSeaCmd`` Changes That Break Backward Compatibility
*************************************************************

.. _BreakingChangesVersion23.1:

Version 23.1
============

The following change that was introduced in version 23.1 of the ``SalishSeaCmd``
package is incompatible with earlier versions:

* Drop support for Python 3.10.
  Minimum supported Python version is now 3.11.


.. _BreakingChangesVersion22.3:

Version 22.3
============

The following change that was introduced in version 22.3 of the ``SalishSeaCmd``
package is incompatible with earlier versions:

* Drop support for Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9.
  Minimum supported Python version is now 3.10.
  Python 3.5 version deployed on ``orcinus`` is tagged ``orcinus-python-3.5``.


.. _BreakingChangesVersion22.2:

Version 22.2
============

The following change that was introduced in version 22.2 of the ``SalishSeaCmd``
package is incompatible with earlier versions:

* Replaced the :command:`salishsea run --cedar-broadwell` command-line flag with
  more generic ``--cores-per-node`` and ``cpu-arch`` options.
  This change enables more general control of HPC job configuration on clusters
  where that is applicable
  (presently ``sockeye`` and ``cedar``).

  To reproduce the effect of ``--cedar-broadwell`` now,
  please use ``--cores-per-node 32 --cpu-arch broadwell``.


.. _BreakingChangesVersion19.3:

Version 19.3
============

The following change that was introduced in version 19.3 of the ``SalishSeaCmd``
package is incompatible with earlier versions:

* The `gitpython`_ package is now a required dependency.
  It can be installed with :command:`pip install --user gitpython` or
  :command:`conda install gitpython` as appropriate for your working environment.

  .. _gitpython: https://gitpython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/


.. _BreakingChangesVersion19.1:

Version 19.1
============

The following changes that were introduced in version 19.1 of the ``SalishSeaCmd``
package are incompatible with earlier versions:

* Dropped support for Python 2.7; minimum version is now 3.5.

* The `f90nml`_ package is now a required dependency.
  It can be installed with :command:`pip install --user f90nml` or
  :command:`conda install f90nml` as appropriate for your working environment.

  .. _f90nml: https://f90nml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

* ``segmented run`` is now an optional key in the run description YAML file.
  Please see :ref:`SegmentedRuns` for details of how to use it.

* Changed to `CalVer`_ versioning convention.
  Version identifier format is now ``yy.n[.devn]``,
  where ``yy`` is the (post-2000) year of release,
  and ``n`` is the number of the release within the year, starting at ``1``.
  After a release has been made the value of ``n`` is incremented by 1,
  and ``.dev0`` is appended to the version identifier to indicate changes that will be
  included in the next release.
  ``19.1.dev0`` is an exception to that scheme.
  That version identifies the period of development between the ``3.5`` and ``19.1``
  releases.

Version 3.4
===========

The following changes that were introduced in version 3.4 of the ``SalishSeaCmd``
package are incompatible with earlier versions:

* Replaced the :command:`salishsea run --no-deflate` command-line option with
  :command:`salishsea run --deflate` so that the default run options assume that
  XIOS-2 on-the-fly deflation is being used.
* Dropped ``bugaboo`` from the list of recognized systems.
* Default to using account ``rrg-allen`` when running on ``cedar``.
* Dropped support for NEMO-3.4.


Version 3.3
===========

The following change that was introduced in version 3.3 of the ``SalishSeaCmd`` package
is incompatible with earlier versions:

* The :command:`salishsea get_cgrf` sub-command was removed.


Version 3.1
===========

The following changes that were introduced in version 3.1 of the ``SalishSeaCmd``
package are incompatible with earlier versions:

* For NEMO-3.6 only,
  :ref:`LandProcessorElimination` configuration must now be done explicitly,
  in contrast to being automatic in version 3.0.
  This change is necessary to accommodate the fact that the MPI-LPE mapping changes
  with bathymetry,
  so it is necessary to specify the MPI-LPE mapping CSV file that corresponds to the
  bathymetry you are using in the run description YAML file.

  The ``land processor elimination`` key has moved from the top level of the YAML file
  (where it was previously only used with a value of :py:obj:`False` to disable
  land processor elimination)
  to the ``grid`` section.
  The value associated with the ``land processor elimination`` key is the path/filename
  of the MPI-LPE mapping CSV file to be used for the run.

  Please see the YAML file :ref:`NEMO-3.6-Grid` docs for details.

* For NEMO-3.6 only,
  restart file paths/filenames are now specified in a new ``restart`` section instead
  of in the :kbd:`forcing` section;
  see :ref:`NEMO-3.6-Restart` for details.


Version 3.0
===========

The following change that was introduced in version 3.0 of the ``SalishSeaCmd`` package
is incompatible with earlier versions:

* The ``paths`` section of the YAML run description file must now contain a
  ``NEMO code config`` key,
  the value of which is the path to the :file:`CONFIG/` directory in the NEMO code tree.
  An absolute path is required because the path is used in both the current directory
  and the temporary run directory created in the ``runs directory``.
  The path may contain ``~`` or :envvar:`$HOME` as alternative spellings of the user's
  home directory,
  and :envvar:`$USER` as an alternative spelling of the user's userid.
  Examples:

  .. code-block:: yaml

      NEMO code config: $HOME/MEOPAR/NEMO-3.6-code/NEMOGCM/CONFIG

      NEMO code config: /data/sallen/MEOPAR/NEMO-code/NEMOGCM/CONFIG


Version 2.2
===========

The following changes that were introduced in version 2.2 of the ``SalishSeaCmd``
package are incompatible with earlier versions:

* Specification of which :file:`iodef.xml` file NEMO should use has been moved from the
  command-line to the YAML run description file;
  see :ref:`salishsea-run` or use :command:`salishsea help run` to see the new
  command-line usage.

  * For NEMO-3.6 the ``output`` section of the run description YAML file must now contain
    a ``files`` key,
    the value of which is the file path/name of the :file:`iodef.xml` file to use for
    the run.
    For example:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        output:
          files: iodef.xml

    If the path is relative,
    it is taken from the directory in which the run description YAML file resides.

  * For NEMO-3.4 the run description YAML file must now contain an ``output`` section
    that contains a ``files`` key,
    the value of which is the file path/name of the :file:`iodef.xml` file to use for
    the run.
    For example:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        output:
          files: iodef.xml

    If the path is relative,
    it is taken from the directory in which the run description YAML file resides.

  This change also affects the :ref:`salishsea-prepare` sub-command,
  and the the following APIs:

  * :py:func:`salishsea_cmd.api.prepare`
  * :py:func:`salishsea_cmd.api.run_description`
  * :py:func:`salishsea_cmd.api.run_in_subprocess`



Version 2.1
===========

The following changes that were introduced in version 2.1 of the ``SalishSeaCmd``
package are incompatible with earlier versions:

* For NEMO-3.6 the ``forcing`` section of the run description YAML file now contains
  sub-sections that provide the names of directories and file that are to be symlinked
  in the run directory for NEMO to use to read initial conditions and forcing values from.
  For example:

  .. code-block:: yaml

      forcing:
        NEMO-atmos:
          link to: /results/forcing/atmospheric/GEM2.5/operational/
        restart.nc:
          link to: /results/SalishSea/nowcast-green/06dec15/SalishSea_00004320_restart.nc
        restart_trc.nc:
          link to: /results/SalishSea/nowcast-green/06dec15/SalishSea_00004320_restart_trc.nc
        open_boundaries:
          link to: open_boundaries/
        rivers:
          link to: rivers/

  The keys are the names of the symlinks that will be created in the run directory.
  Those names are expected to appear in the appropriate places in the namelists.
  The values associated with the ``link to`` keys are the targets of the symlinks
  that will be created.

  A sub-section that provides a directory of atmospheric forcing files to link to
  may also include a ``check link`` sub-sub-section.
  ``check link`` contains 2 key-value pairs:

  * The ``type`` key provides the type of checking to perform on the link
  * The value associated with the ``namelist filename`` key is the name of the
    namelist file in which the atmospheric forcing link is used.

  .. code-block:: yaml

    forcing:
      NEMO-atmos:
        link to: /results/forcing/atmospheric/GEM2.5/operational/
        check link:
          type: atmospheric
          namelist filename: namelist_cfg

  Link checking can be disabled by excluding the ``check link`` section,
  or by setting the value associated with the ``type`` key to :py:obj:`None`.

  See :ref:`NEMO-3.6-Forcing` for details.

  For NEMO-3.4 the ``forcing`` section is unchanged,
  the hard-coded symlink names remain the same,
  and provision of a tracers restart file is not supported.


* For NEMO-3.6 the ``namelists`` section of the run description YAML file is now a
  dict of lists.
  The dict keys are the names of the :file:`namelist*_cfg` files to create and
  the element(s) of the list under each key are the namelist section files to be
  concatenated to create the file named by the key.
  For example:

  .. code-block:: yaml

      namelists:
        namelist_cfg:
          - namelist.time
          - namelist.domain
          - namelist.surface
          - namelist.lateral
          - namelist.bottom
          - namelist.tracer
          - namelist.dynamics
          - namelist.vertical
          - namelist.compute
        namelist_top_cfg:
          - namelist_top_cfg
        namelist_pisces_cfg:
          - namelist_pisces_cfg

  The ``namelist_cfg`` key is required to create the basic namelist for running
  NEMO-3.6.
  Other ``namelist*_cfg`` keys are optional.
  At least 1 namelist section file is required for each ``namelist*_cfg`` key
  that is used.

  See :ref:`NEMO-3.6-Namelists` for details.

  For NEMO-3.4 the ``namelists`` section remains a simple list of namelist section files,
  and construction of namelists for tracers,
  biology,
  etc. is not supported.

* The :py:func:`SalishSeaCmd.api.run_description` and
  :py:func:`SalishSeaCmd.api.run_in_subprocess` functions now accept a
  ``nemo34`` argument that defaults to :py:obj:`False`.
  That means that those functions now assume that their objective is a NEMO-3.6 run.

* In the :py:func:`SalishSeaCmd.api.run_description` function,
  the name of the argument that is used to pass in the path to the
  :file:`NEMO-forcing/` directory has been changed from ``forcing`` to ``forcing_path``.
  This change affects both NEMO-3.4 and NEMO-3.6 uses of the function.

* The :py:func:`SalishSeaCmd.api.run_description` function now accepts a
  ``forcing`` argument that can be used to pass in a forcing links :py:obj:`dict`.
  The :py:obj:`dict` must match the forcing links data structure described in
  :ref:`RunDescriptionFileStructure` for the version of NEMO that you are using.
  For NEMO-3.4,
  the default value of :py:obj:`None` will result in "sensible" default values being
  set for the forcing links.
  For NEMO-3.6,
  it is impossible to guess what "sensible" default values might be,
  so the default value of :py:obj:`None` is simply passed through.


Version 2.0
===========

The following changes that were introduced in version 2.0 of the ``SalishSeaCmd``
package are incompatible with earlier versions:

* The ``gather`` and ``combine`` sub-commands now take a ``--compress`` command-line
  option to cause the results files to be :program:`gzip` compressed.
  Previously,
  :program:`gzip` compression was the default and the ``--no-compress`` option was
  required to prevent it.
  The ``run``,
  ``gather``,
  and ``combine`` sub-commands are now all consistent in defaulting to no compression
  of the results files.

* The run description YAML file must now contain an :kbd:`MPI decomposition`
  key-value pair,
  for example:

  .. code-block:: yaml

      MPI decomposition: 8x18

  The value is used to write the correct MPI decomposition values into the
  :file:`namelist.compute` namelist section file.
  That means that it is no longer necessary to a collection of :file:`namelist.compute.*`
  files for different MPI decompositions.
  The value is also used to tell the :program:`REBUILD_NEMO` script how many
  results file sections to operate on.
