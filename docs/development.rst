.. _SalishSeaCmdPythonVersions:

Python Versions
===============

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.10%20%7C%203.11-blue?logo=python&label=Python&logoColor=gold
    :target: https://docs.python.org/3.11/
    :alt: Python Version

The :kbd:`SalishSeaCmd` package is developed using `Python`_ 3.11.
The minimum supported Python version is 3.10.
The :ref:`SalishSeaCmdContinuousIntegration` workflow on GitHub ensures that the package
is tested for all versions of Python>=3.10.
An old version of the package running under Python 3.5 is depoloyed on the
Westgrid :kbd:`orcinus` HPC platform.
That version is tagged in the repository as ``orcinus-python-3.5``.

.. _SalishSeaCmdGettingTheCode:

Getting the Code
================

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/version%20control-git-blue.svg?logo=github
    :target: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/SalishSeaCmd
    :alt: Git on GitHub

Clone the :ref:`SalishSeaCmd-repo` code and documentation `repository`_ from GitHub with:

.. _repository: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/SalishSeaCmd

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git@github.com:SalishSeaCast/SalishSeaCmd.git


.. _SalishSeaCmdDevelopmentEnvironment:

Development Environment
=======================

The :kbd:`SalishSeaCmd` package depends on the :kbd:`NEMO-Cmd` package,
so you need to clone its repo,
:ref:`NEMO-Cmd-repo`,
beside your clone of :ref:`SalishSeaCmd-repo`.

Setting up an isolated development environment using `Conda`_ is recommended.
Assuming that you have :ref:`AnacondaPythonDistro` or `Miniconda3`_ installed,
you can create and activate an environment called :kbd:`salishsea-cmd` that will have all of the Python packages necessary for development,
testing,
and building the documentation with the commands:

.. _Conda: https://conda.io/en/latest/
.. _Miniconda3: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda env create -f SalishSeaCmd/envs/environment-dev.yaml
    $ conda activate salishsea-cmd
    (salishsea-cmd)$ pip install --editable NEMO-Cmd
    (salishsea-cmd)$ pip install --editable SalishSeaCmd

The :kbd:`--editable` option in the :command:`pip install` commands above installs the :kbd:`NEMO-Cmd` package and the :kbd:`SalishSeaCmd` packages via symlinks so that :program:`salishsea` in the :kbd:`salishsea-cmd` environment will be automatically updated as the repos evolve.

To deactivate the environment use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (salishsea-cmd)$ conda deactivate


.. _SalishSeaCmdCodingStyle:

Coding Style
============

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/pre--commit-enabled-brightgreen?logo=pre-commit&logoColor=white
    :target: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit
    :alt: pre-commit
.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg
    :target: https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
    :alt: The uncompromising Python code formatter

The ``SalishSeaCmd`` package uses Git pre-commit hooks managed by `pre-commit`_ to
maintain consistent code style and and other aspects of code,
docs,
and repo QA.

.. _pre-commit: https://pre-commit.com/

To install the `pre-commit` hooks in a newly cloned repo,
activate the conda development environment,
and run :command:`pre-commit install`:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd SalishSeaCmd
    $ conda activate nemo-cmd
    (nemo-cmd)$ pre-commit install

.. note::
    You only need to install the hooks once immediately after you make a new clone
    of the `SalishSeaCmd repository`_ and build your :ref:`SalishSeaCmdDevelopmentEnvironment`.

.. _SalishSeaCmd repository: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/SalishSeaCmd


.. _SalishSeaCmdBuildingTheDocumentation:

Building the Documentation
==========================

.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/salishseacmd/badge/?version=latest
    :target: https://salishseacmd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
    :alt: Documentation Status

The documentation for the :kbd:`SalishSeaCmd` package is written in `reStructuredText`_ and converted to HTML using `Sphinx`_.

.. _reStructuredText: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html
.. _Sphinx: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/

If you have write access to the `repository`_ on GitHub,
whenever you push changes to GitHub the documentation is automatically re-built and rendered at https://salishseacmd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

Additions,
improvements,
and corrections to these docs are *always* welcome.

The quickest way to fix typos, etc. on existing pages is to use the :guilabel:`Edit on GitHub` link in the upper right corner of the page to get to the online editor for the page on `GitHub`_.

.. _GitHub: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/SalishSeaCmd

For more substantial work,
and to add new pages,
follow the instructions in the :ref:`SalishSeaCmdDevelopmentEnvironment` section above.
In the development environment you can build the docs locally instead of having to push commits to GitHub to trigger a `build on readthedocs.org`_ and wait for it to complete.
Below are instructions that explain how to:

.. _build on readthedocs.org: https://readthedocs.org/projects/salishseacmd/builds/

* build the docs with your changes,
  and preview them in Firefox

* check the docs for broken links


.. _SalishSeaCmdBuildingAndPreviewingTheDocumentation:

Building and Previewing the Documentation
-----------------------------------------

Building the documentation is driven by :file:`docs/Makefile`.
With your :kbd:`salishsea-cmd` development environment activated,
use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (salishsea-cmd)$ (cd docs && make clean html)

to do a clean build of the documentation.
The output looks something like::

  Removing everything under '_build'...

  build succeeded.

  Build finished. The HTML pages are in _build/html.


The HTML rendering of the docs ends up in :file:`docs/_build/html/`.
You can open the :file:`index.html` file in that directory tree in your browser to preview the results of the build before committing and pushing your changes to GitHub.

Whenever you push changes to the :ref:`SalishSeaCmd-repo` on GitHub the documentation is automatically re-built and rendered at https://salishseacmd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.


.. _SalishSeaCmdLinkCheckingTheDocumentation:

Link Checking the Documentation
-------------------------------

.. image:: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/SalishSeaCmd/workflows/sphinx-linkcheck/badge.svg
    :target: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/SalishSeaCmd/actions?query=workflow%3Asphinx-linkcheck
    :alt: Sphinx linkcheck

Sphinx also provides a link checker utility which can be run to find broken or redirected links in the docs.
With your :kbd:`salishsea-cmd` environment activated,
use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (salishsea-cmd)$ cd SalishSeaCmd/docs/
    (salishsea-cmd) docs$ make linkcheck

The output looks something like::
