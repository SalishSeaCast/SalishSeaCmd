.. _SalishSeaCmdPythonVersions:

Python Versions
===============

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/python/required-version-toml?tomlFilePath=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SalishSeaCast/SalishSeaCmd/main/pyproject.toml&logo=Python&logoColor=gold&label=Python
    :target: https://docs.python.org/3.12/
    :alt: Python Version from PEP 621 TOML

The :kbd:`SalishSeaCmd` package is developed using `Python`_ 3.12.
The minimum supported Python version is 3.11.
The :ref:`SalishSeaCmdContinuousIntegration` workflow on GitHub ensures that the package
is tested for all versions of Python>=3.11.
An old version of the package running under Python 3.5 is depoloyed on the
Westgrid :kbd:`orcinus` HPC platform.
That version is tagged in the repository as ``orcinus-python-3.5``.

    :target: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/SalishSeaCmd
    :alt: Git on GitHub

Clone the :ref:`SalishSeaCmd-repo` code and documentation `repository`_ from GitHub with:

.. _repository: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/SalishSeaCmd

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git@github.com:SalishSeaCast/SalishSeaCmd.git


.. _SalishSeaCmdDevelopmentEnvironment:

Development Environment
=======================

The :kbd:`SalishSeaCmd` package depends on the :kbd:`NEMO-Cmd` package,
so you need to clone its repo,
:ref:`NEMO-Cmd-repo`,
beside your clone of :ref:`SalishSeaCmd-repo`.

Setting up an isolated development environment using `Conda`_ is recommended.
Assuming that you have :ref:`AnacondaPythonDistro` or `Miniconda3`_ installed,
you can create and activate an environment called :kbd:`salishsea-cmd` that will have all of the Python packages necessary for development,
testing,
and building the documentation with the commands:

.. _Miniconda3: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda env create -f SalishSeaCmd/envs/environment-dev.yaml
    $ conda activate salishsea-cmd
    (salishsea-cmd)$ pip install --editable NEMO-Cmd
    (salishsea-cmd)$ pip install --editable SalishSeaCmd

The :kbd:`--editable` option in the :command:`pip install` commands above installs the :kbd:`NEMO-Cmd` package and the :kbd:`SalishSeaCmd` packages via symlinks so that :program:`salishsea` in the :kbd:`salishsea-cmd` environment will be automatically updated as the repos evolve.

To deactivate the environment use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (salishsea-cmd)$ conda deactivate


.. _SalishSeaCmdCodingStyle:

Coding Style
============

    :target: https://pre-commit.com
    :alt: pre-commit
.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg
    :target: https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
    :alt: The uncompromising Python code formatter

The ``SalishSeaCmd`` package uses Git pre-commit hooks managed by `pre-commit`_ to
maintain consistent code style and and other aspects of code,
docs,
and repo QA.

.. _pre-commit: https://pre-commit.com/

To install the `pre-commit` hooks in a newly cloned repo,
activate the conda development environment,
and run :command:`pre-commit install`:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd SalishSeaCmd
    $ conda activate nemo-cmd
    (nemo-cmd)$ pre-commit install

.. note::
    You only need to install the hooks once immediately after you make a new clone
    of the `SalishSeaCmd repository`_ and build your :ref:`SalishSeaCmdDevelopmentEnvironment`.

.. _SalishSeaCmd repository: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/SalishSeaCmd


.. _SalishSeaCmdBuildingTheDocumentation:

Building the Documentation
==========================

.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/salishseacmd/badge/?version=latest
    :target: https://salishseacmd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
    :alt: Documentation Status

The documentation for the :kbd:`SalishSeaCmd` package is written in `reStructuredText`_ and converted to HTML using `Sphinx`_.

.. _reStructuredText: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html
.. _Sphinx: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/

If you have write access to the `repository`_ on GitHub,
whenever you push changes to GitHub the documentation is automatically re-built and rendered at https://salishseacmd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

Additions,
improvements,
and corrections to these docs are *always* welcome.

The quickest way to fix typos, etc. on existing pages is to use the :guilabel:`Edit on GitHub` link in the upper right corner of the page to get to the online editor for the page on `GitHub`_.

.. _GitHub: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/SalishSeaCmd

For more substantial work,
and to add new pages,
follow the instructions in the :ref:`SalishSeaCmdDevelopmentEnvironment` section above.
In the development environment you can build the docs locally instead of having to push commits to GitHub to trigger a `build on readthedocs.org`_ and wait for it to complete.
Below are instructions that explain how to:

.. _build on readthedocs.org: https://readthedocs.org/projects/salishseacmd/builds/

* build the docs with your changes,
  and preview them in Firefox

* check the docs for broken links


.. _SalishSeaCmdBuildingAndPreviewingTheDocumentation:

Building and Previewing the Documentation
-----------------------------------------

Building the documentation is driven by :file:`docs/Makefile`.
With your :kbd:`salishsea-cmd` development environment activated,
use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (salishsea-cmd)$ (cd docs && make clean html)

to do a clean build of the documentation.
The output looks something like:

.. code-block:: text

    The HTML pages are in _build/html.

The HTML rendering of the docs ends up in :file:`docs/_build/html/`.
You can open the :file:`index.html` file in that directory tree in your browser to preview the results of the build before committing and pushing your changes to GitHub.

Whenever you push changes to the :ref:`SalishSeaCmd-repo` on GitHub the documentation is automatically re-built and rendered at https://salishseacmd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.


.. _SalishSeaCmdLinkCheckingTheDocumentation:

Link Checking the Documentation
-------------------------------

    :target: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/SalishSeaCmd/actions?query=workflow:sphinx-linkcheck
    :alt: Sphinx linkcheck

Sphinx also provides a link checker utility which can be run to find broken or redirected links in the docs.
With your :kbd:`salishsea-cmd` environment activated,
use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (salishsea-cmd)$ cd SalishSeaCmd/docs/
    (salishsea-cmd) docs$ make linkcheck

The output looks something like:

Running the Unit Tests
======================

The test suite for the :kbd:`SalishSeaCmd` package is in :file:`SalishSeaCmd/tests/`.
The `pytest`_ tool is used for test fixtures and as the test runner for the suite.

.. _pytest: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/

With your :kbd:`salishsea-cmd` development environment activated,
use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (salishsea-cmd)$ cd SalishSeaCmd/
    (salishsea-cmd)$ pytest

to run the test suite.
The output looks something like:

You can monitor what lines of code the test suite exercises using the `coverage.py`_ and `pytest-cov`_ tools with the command:

.. _coverage.py: https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
.. _pytest-cov: https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

.. code-block:: bash

    (salishsea-cmd)$ cd SalishSeaCmd/
    (salishsea-cmd)$ cpytest --cov=./

The test coverage report will be displayed below the test suite run output.

Alternatively,
you can use

.. code-block:: bash

    (salishsea-cmd)$ pytest --cov=./ --cov-report html

to produce an HTML report that you can view in your browser by opening

Releases are done at Doug's discretion when significant pieces of development work have been
completed.

The release process steps are:

#. Use :command:`hatch version release` to bump the version from ``.devn`` to the next release
   version identifier

#. Confirm that :file:`docs/breaking_changes.rst` includes any relevant notes for the
   version being released

#. Commit the version bump and breaking changes log update

#. Create an annotated tag for the release with :guilabel:`Git -> New Tag...` in PyCharm
   or :command:`git tag -e -a vyy.n`

#. Push the version bump commit and tag to GitHub

#. Use the GitHub web interface to create a release,
   editing the auto-generated release notes as necessary

#. Use the GitHub :guilabel:`Issues -> Milestones` web interface to edit the release
   milestone:

   * Change the :guilabel:`Due date` to the release date
   * Delete the "when it's ready" comment in the :guilabel:`Description`

#. Use the GitHub :guilabel:`Issues -> Milestones` web interface to create a milestone for
   the next release:

   * Set the :guilabel:`Title` to the next release version,
     prepended with a ``v``;
     e.g. ``v23.1``
   * Set the :guilabel:`Due date` to the end of the year of the next release
   * Set the :guilabel:`Description` to something like
     ``v23.1 release - when it's ready :-)``
   * Create the next release milestone

#. Review the open issues,
   especially any that are associated with the milestone for the just released version,
   and update their milestone.

#. Close the milestone for the just released version.

#. Use :command:`hatch version minor,dev` to bump the version for the next development cycle,
   or use :command:`hatch version major,minor,dev` for a year rollover version bump

#. Commit the version bump

#. Push the version bump commit to GitHub
